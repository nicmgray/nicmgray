- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nicmgray

- I work on Democratic campaigns and am looking to move over to the Data side of that world. I have some training from Arena Academy on data management in a political campaign context, and I've been working on my Google Cloud and SQL skills since then. 

-If you know of anyone looking for a junior-ish data person with an organizing background, hmu! I'm on Twitter as @nicmgray or Linkedin at linkedin.com/in/nicmgray
